This is the Gnome Shell Biff extension. It provides a visual notification in
the Gnome Shell status panel, indicating whether unread mail exists in the
user's mail accounts, and if so, how many messages.

Clicking on the icon launches the default Gnome mail application.

Gnome Biff doesn't define its own mail account settings, it takes them from
Evolution. So you need to define your mail accounts in Evolution's settings,
although you don't need to use Evolution as a mail client. You need to have
set up the passwords to the accounts in Evolution as well, these are stored in
your Gnome keyring and are not accessible to anyone but you.

SASL PLAIN and CRAM-MD5 authentication mechanisms are supported in addition to
standard IMAP login. Gnome Biff won't authenticate unless either a secure
authentication method such as CRAM-MD5 is used or the connection is
encrypted using SSL/TLS: this ensures that your password is never sent out
in the clear over the network.
